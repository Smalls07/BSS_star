# BSS_star
Code to run the newly proposed method.

minBIC_03182022.R: the optimization function. Need to source this function before running analysis using other functions.

BIC_cont.R: the function to minimize BIC for continuous data sets.

BIC_binary.R: the function to minimize BIC for binary data sets.

fit0norm_leastSquares.R: the function to solve l_0 norm penalized least squares problem for linear models.

auto-mog.data: an example continuous data set.

torun.R: an example of running the analyses.
